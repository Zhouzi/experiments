# tic-tac-toe-tdd

## Goal

* Practice TDD
* Give a try to [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape)
  * Considered the best JavaScript unit test library by [Eric Elliott](https://twitter.com/_ericelliott), read [Why I use Tape Instead of Mocha & So Should You](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/why-i-use-tape-instead-of-mocha-so-should-you-6aa105d8eaf4#.l78rnu81k)
* Improve my functional programming skills (enforced by eslint with a configuration inspired by [eslint-config-cleanjs](https://github.com/bodil/eslint-config-cleanjs))

## Exercise

1. Build a regular 3x3 Tic Tac Toe game, environment agnostic (shouldn't be coupled to the DOM).
  * 2 players, turn by turn
2. Create a DOM view layer.
  * Bonus: create a command line layer.
3. Add some AI.
  * Should be able to play against an AI controlled player.
4. The game size should be configurable, while remaining a square.
